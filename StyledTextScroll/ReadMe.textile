h1. StyledText Scrolling

This project covers a bug in the StyledText control which makes scrolling text with lots of commas 5x slower than normal text.

This bug has been observed on Windows 7. To test it on your own platform you should do the following:

* Download the example jar: 
* Run the jar from the command line
** Windows/Linux - "java -jar styledtextscroll.jar"
** OSX - "java -jar styledtextscroll.jar -XstartOnFirstThread"
* Click the Start button and wait while both text boxes are scrolled
* The timing results are displayed in a message box
